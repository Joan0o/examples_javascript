# Runway + JavaScript

A collection of stand alone examples of connecting [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) to [JavaScript](https://processing.org/).
Examples are separated by current available models.

## Examples

- [im2txt](/im2txt)
- [OpenPose](/openpose)

## Library

Ideally this will be a Processing Library that manages the OSC connection to Runway. For now all examples are using Processing [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/) library.

## Contributing

This is still a work in progress. Contributions are welcomed!
