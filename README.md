# Runway + JavaScript

A collection of stand alone examples of connecting [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) to [JavaScript](https://processing.org/).
Examples are separated by current available models.

## Examples

- [im2txt](/im2txt)
- [OpenPose](/openpose)

## Library

Ideally this will be a JavaScript Library that manages the socket connections. For now all examples are using [socket.io](https://socket.io/) to get real-time data. Some examples use [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to draw things on the canvas.

## Contributing

This is still a work in progress. Contributions are welcomed!
